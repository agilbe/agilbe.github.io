				<div class="textleft"><h3>About Me</h3>
				<p> <span id="special">Hi! My name is Alex Gilbert, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington.
				I'm both a designer and an engineer, interested in building new technologies as well as the design and thought for the users that goes into them. I'm looking to get involved in the usability field 
				(both hardware and software) or interaction design. </br></br>
				Welcome to my portfolio - click on any of the titles to check out the project in more detail! Also, <a href="resume.html">check out my resume here</a>.</br></br></span>
				Note: Thanks for putting up with my constantly-changing website - it's under construction indefinitely. I'd rather build a cool website on my own than throw it up online somewhere, but that means it always needs improvement! If you have any ideas or find any issues, don't hesitate to <a href="#resume/contact info">contact me</a> and let me know.</p>

				<p>Design project completed for a user-centered design course. Tuber is intended to solve the problem of unreasonably long airport security checkpoints; our proposed system utilizes a TSA-run ride service which transports users to the airport and scans them and their luggage, allowing them to safely bypass the checkpoint. In the creation of
				Tuber, we practiced user research, creating personas, brainstorming scenarios and storyboarding them, as well as prototyping and creating mockups.</p>
