				<div class="textleft"><h3>About Me</h3>
				<p> <span id="special">Hi! My name is Alex Gilbert, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington.
				I'm both a designer and an engineer, interested in building new technologies as well as the design and thought for the users that goes into them. I'm looking to get involved in the usability field 
				(both hardware and software) or interaction design. </br></br>
				Welcome to my portfolio - click on any of the titles to check out the project in more detail! Also, <a href="resume.html">check out my resume here</a>.</br></br></span>
				Note: Thanks for putting up with my constantly-changing website - it's under construction indefinitely. I'd rather build a cool website on my own than throw it up online somewhere, but that means it always needs improvement! If you have any ideas or find any issues, don't hesitate to <a href="#resume/contact info">contact me</a> and let me know.</p>

				<div class="textright"><h3><a href="http://learnyourlegends.appspot.com">Learn your Legends</a></h3>
				<p>A web app which uses Riot Games' API to check game statistics based on username. Built using Python and hosted on Google's App Engine. I play way too much League of Legends for my own good, so I figured I'd channel that LoL excitement into something productive.</p>

				<div class = "textleft"><h3><a href="denologo.png">Democracy Evolved</a></h3>
				<p>Infographic and website concept created for INFO 200 in Spring Quarter 2015 with Beth Patin. Won best in show at the end of the quarter! Our research found that it was incredibly hard for people who hadn't followed politics closely to obtain unbiased information on candidates and bills up for election; we envisioned Democracy Evolved as a one-stop hub for information on anything political.</p>

				<div class = "textright"><h3><a href="http://chin-gilbert.weebly.com/">Howl's Moving Castle</a></h3>
				<p>Designed and built a hub of a smart city for a physical computing course. Modeled after Howl's Moving castle, our project used two Arduino boards to make our castle respond to disaster alerts sent over radio waves. To accomplish this, we learned programming in C as well as how to work with electronics. We also 3D printed legs to make our castle move. It even plays Howl's Moving Castle's theme song!</p><p>Check out the video to the left or click the link above to read about the project in more detail.</p>

			<div id ="tuber: tsa uber" class = "example">
				<div class="textleft"><h3><a href="http://tuberapp.weebly.com/">Tuber</a></h3>
				<p>Design project completed for a user-centered design course. Tuber is intended to solve the problem of unreasonably long airport security checkpoints; our proposed system utilizes a TSA-run ride service which transports users to the airport and scans them and their luggage, allowing them to safely bypass the checkpoint. In the creation of
				Tuber, we practiced user research, creating personas, brainstorming scenarios and storyboarding them, as well as prototyping and creating mockups.</p><p>See our steps by clicking on the link above!</p>
